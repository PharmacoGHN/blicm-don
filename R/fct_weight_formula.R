#' @title weight_formula
#'
#' @description
#' this function calculated different weight indicator, such as
#' the Ideal Body weigh (IBW) or the adjusted bodyweight (AJBW)
#'
#' @param weight correspond to the total body weigt in kg or lbs
#' @param height correspond to the patient height (only in cm)
#' @param sex correspond to the patient sex
#' @param weight_unit should be either kg or lbs
#' @param formula correspond to the formula used. Can take value in c(IBW, AJBW, LBW)
